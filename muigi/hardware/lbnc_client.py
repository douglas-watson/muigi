#       Connect to the serial driver, and issue some commands. This script is
#       for debugging, or used as a library to hide the RPC code.

    lbnc_client.py

A debugging script for the LBNC driver. When run alone, this script connects to
the LBNC driver and randomly sets the states of port A and B to random.
Clicking in the valves indicates everything is working correctly.

    ARGUMENTS:
    both arguments are binary numbers as strings, each bit represents the

    a - state of port A
    b - same, for port B

    RETURNS:
    A status code, and a message intended for relaying to the end user.
    Status codes:
    0 - Success
    1 - Serial Error (any kind)

    Other exceptions may appear. In any case, they will return a status code
