""" The easyDAQ library

Provides an API to control the EasyDAQ USB24Mx 24-relay USB card.
The card has three 'ports' (B, C, and D), each controlling eight relays, making
a total of twenty-four. Relays 1 to 8 are on port A, relays 9 to 16 on port B,
relays 17 to 24 on port C.

To control the DAQ, create an instance of the Controller class, then establish
a connection, and start sending commands:

>> from easydaq24 import Controller
>> daq = Controller('/dev/ttyUSB1')
>> daq.connect()
>> daq.set_state(12, 1) # activates channel 12
>> time.sleep(10)
>> daq.set_states([1] * 12 + [0] * 12) # activate first 12 channels.
>> daq.disconnect()

Please note that the terminology adapted (in terms of ports, channels, and
directions for example), are those used by EasyDAQ in their datasheet.
