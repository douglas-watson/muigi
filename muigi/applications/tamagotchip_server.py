#   tamagotchip.py - RPC interface for the Tamagotchip microfluidic game
#
#   PURPOSE: 
#       Provides an RPC interface to functions of the tamagotchip microfluidic
#       game. The web application can connect to this using the RPyC library,
#       and control the chip using high-level commands.

    tamagotchip.py [-p PORT]

    If executed alone, start an RPC server, providing control over the
    tamagotchip game. If the RPyC name server is running, it will advertise the
    service "TAMAGOTCHIP" through the name server, allowing a connection to
    be established with the rpyc.connect_by_service() function.
