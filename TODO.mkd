Next steps:

- Package the app into a python module
- find how I can run the serial tests only when hardware is connected (to avoid tons of failures when I run the other tests and hardware is not connected).
 - write a python script that checks that the serial device in settings is available, and runs those tests only if it is. Then just run the standard nosetests. All that in a python script, or with a bash script "glue".
