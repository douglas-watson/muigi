Drivers
=======

What Muigi calls a "driver" is not actually a low-level kernel driver, but
rather a collection of methods that helps set up communication with your
microfluidics hardware (be it a DAQ, or a microcontroller), and then control
it. It should typically provide both low-level and high-level commands: the
low-level ones set the states of the valves one by one, the higher level ones
carry a function, such as flushing the chip, or whatever your experiments
usually call for.

There is currently a single driver available: the LBNC driver, for LBNC's
home-built microcontroller.
