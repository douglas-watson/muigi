Welcome to Muigi the Microplumber's documentation!
==================================================

*Muigi the Microplumber* is a set of tools to control microfluidic devices.
Currently, it provides drivers to communicate with hardware (and therefore
simplify that task for any other piece of python software) as well as a web
interface to control a setup from a web browser. It also provides an
'application' layer for example applications (only a gradient chip for the
moment)
